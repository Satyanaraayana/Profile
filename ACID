1.ACID property
	1. Atomicity: “All or Nothing” - transaction is atomic, it means that either the entire transaction completes fully or doesn’t execute at all. 
	There is no in-between state.
	Commit: If the transaction is successful, the changes are permanently applied.
	Abort/Rollback: If the transaction fails, any changes made during the transaction are discarded.
	-- if any part of the transaction fails, the entire process is rolled back to its original state.
	
	2. Consistency: Maintaining Valid Data States
	Example: Suppose the sum of all balances in a bank system should always be constant. Before a transfer, the total balance is $700. 
	After the transaction, the total balance should remain $700. 
	If the transaction fails in the middle (like updating one account but not the other), 
	the system should maintain its consistency by rolling back the transaction
	Total before T occurs = 500 + 200 = 700 .
	Total after T occurs = 400 + 300 = 700 .
	
	
	3. Isolation: Ensuring Concurrent Transactions Don’t Interfere
	This property ensures that when multiple transactions run at the same time, 
	the result will be the same as if they were run one after another in a specific order. 
	This property prevents issues such as dirty reads 
	Transaction T:
	T wants to transfer $50 from X to Y.
	T reads Y (value: 500), deducts $50 from X (new X = 450), and adds $50 to Y (new Y = 550).
	Transaction T”:
	T” starts and reads X (value: 500) and Y (value: 500), then calculates the sum: 500 + 500 = 1000.
	But, by the time T finishes, X and Y have changed to 450 and 550 respectively, so the correct sum should be 450 + 550 = 1000.
	
	4. Durability: Persisting Changes
	the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs. 
	These updates now become permanent and are stored in non-volatile memory.
	Example: After successfully transferring money from Account A to Account B, 
	the changes are stored on disk. Even if there is a crash immediately after the commit, 
	the transfer details will still be intact when the system recovers, ensuring durability.
