To terminate all sleeping sessions in a specific user database in SQL Server, you can use the following steps. 
These sessions are often inactive but may hold resources, so proceed with caution.
Steps to Kill All Sleeping Sessions

1. Identify Sleeping Sessions
Run this query to list all sleeping sessions for a specific database:
SELECT session_id, login_name, status, database_id, db_name(database_id) AS database_name
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE status = 'sleeping'
 AND database_id = DB_ID('YourDatabaseName'); -- Replace 'YourDatabaseName' with your database name
 
2. Generate KILL Commands
To generate KILL commands for these sessions, use the following query:
SELECT 'KILL ' + CAST(session_id AS VARCHAR(10)) AS kill_command
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE status = 'sleeping'
 AND database_id = DB_ID('YourDatabaseName'); -- Replace 'YourDatabaseName' with your database name
Copy the output and execute the generated KILL commands.

3. Kill All Sleeping Sessions Automatically
To automate killing all sleeping sessions for a specific database, use a dynamic SQL script:
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX);
SELECT @sql = STRING_AGG('KILL ' + CAST(session_id AS VARCHAR(10)), '; ')
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE status = 'sleeping'
 AND database_id = DB_ID('YourDatabaseName'); -- Replace 'YourDatabaseName' with your database name
 
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;

Notes and Considerations
• Sleeping Sessions: Sessions in a “sleeping” state may not actively consume resources, but they can cause issues if they are holding locks or blocking other processes.
• Caution: Killing sessions may cause disruptions if the sleeping sessions are part of a larger transaction or application logic. Ensure that the sessions are safe to terminate.
• Monitoring: Before killing sessions, investigate why they are sleeping. For example, look for uncommitted transactions, application-level connection handling issues, or resource contention.
