What is Temp DB Configuration?

During the Installation giving the dedicated Drive is recommended, we can also give the no of TempDB files fields configured that based on the no of logical processors that we have
if we have 4 logical processors we have to add 4 Temp DB files, if we have more than 8 logical processors we have to give 8 files
we can also add more than 8 but recommended is 8.
How many file can we add for TempDB?
its equals to no of Processors that we have, if we have more than 8, the maximum recommended is 8.

To check Tempdbs 
Select name, physical_name as Currentlocation
From sys.master_files
Where database_ID= DB_ID(N’tempdb’);
