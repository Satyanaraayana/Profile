1. master Database:
Purpose: Stores system-level information for the SQL Server instance, such as logins, linked servers, and configuration settings.
Key Features: Essential for starting and managing the SQL Server instance. Cannot start if unavailable.
Note: System objects are now stored in the Resource database. 

2. msdb Database:
Purpose: Used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling jobs and alerts, as well as for managing Database Mail, Service Broker, and replication. 
Key Features: Stores backup and restore history, and information related to SQL Server Agent. 
Note: Contains pre-defined database roles for managing access. 

3. model Database:
Purpose: Serves as the template for creating new user databases.
Key Features: Options set in the model database, such as collation and recovery model, are applied to all newly created databases. 

4. tempdb Database:
Purpose: A workspace for holding temporary objects, such as temporary tables, table variables, and intermediate result sets. 
Key Features: Used for sorts, spools, and other internal engine operations. 
Note: Is a shared resource for the entire instance and can experience resource contention. 

5. resource Database:
Purpose: A read-only database containing the system objects of SQL Server.
Key Features: System objects are physically stored in the Resource database but logically appear in the sys schema of every database.
Note: Helps in faster and easier SQL Server upgrades

--Master 
is used to stores Meta Data-- Data about Data
Tables information
path related data will related , triggers, sp, logins, Endpoint details

--Model 
is prototype/is a Template 
if we create table by using of any one of the model same properties - default properties will apply to new DB

If Master and Model DBs are down SQL server will not start

--MSDB --Supervisor, All jobs will run on schedule time
mainly it is used for automation of jobs.

--Tempdb --is like a Ram
If you want see records in a table it will take dump into TempDB to speed up query result


--MSresourceDB - Hidden Database -- physical files are stored in bin folder
	that is Hidden and Read only DB, that we cont see through the  SSMS.

--When ever we configure replication there is Distribution DB will created

Total we have 6 system DBs
